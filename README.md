setup
=====

Stuff that I use to provision and maintain a bunch of machines,
including personal and work development environments, and a couple of
servers where I host a few small websites.

This project mainly consists of [Ansible][] playbooks and roles, but
thereâ€™s also some [Docker Compose][], [TestInfra][], and [Packer][]
gubbins dotted around.

See the *docs* directory for more information.
