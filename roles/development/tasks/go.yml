# The following tasks install Go via binary archive.
#
#   - If Go has been previously installed using a different method (e.g.
#     a package manager), the following tasks will not delete that
#     version and will need to be removed manually.
#   - The following tasks will install Go in "/usr/local/go". You may
#     need to update your PATH environment variable to include
#     "/usr/local/go/bin" after running these tasks.
