setup
=====

A mess of Ansible stuff that I use to provision and maintain my personal
development environment and a couple of servers that I host a few small
websites on.

  - I currently use Ubuntu 18.04, so the included Ansible playbooks and
    roles have only been tested there.
  - All Ansible hosts must have Python 3 installed beforehand.
  - Mitogen has been included as a dependency, but you'll need to
    [manually set it up][1] for it to take effect.
